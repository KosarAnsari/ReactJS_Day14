Today‚Äôs learning was focused on **two key concepts** in React JS:

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Styling in React JS (`App.jsx`)

I explored **two approaches** to style React components:

### üîπ Inline CSS
- Styles are added directly in JSX using `style={{}}`.
- Useful for quick, component-specific styling.

Example:
```jsx
<h3 style={{ color: 'red', backgroundColor: 'black' }}>Inline CSS</h3>

üîπ External CSS

Styles are placed in a .css file and imported into the component.

Great for reusable and maintainable styles.


Example:

import './App.css';

‚ú® Features Implemented

Theme toggle (Grey, Default, Black)

Grid layout toggle

Card components with images and text

2Ô∏è‚É£ Lifecycle of a React Component (App2.jsx)

React components have three main phases:

1. Mounting ‚Üí Component is added to the DOM (e.g., fetching initial data)


2. Updating ‚Üí Component re-renders when props/state change


3. Unmounting ‚Üí Component is removed from the DOM (cleanup work)



üîπ Functional Component Lifecycle with useEffect

In App2.jsx, I:

Logged Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting phases

Used a count state to trigger updates

Added a toggle button to mount/unmount UI elements


Example:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Mounting / Updating Phase");

  return () => {
    console.log("Unmounting Phase");
  };
}, [count]);
